## Project overview:

The purpose of this project is analyze worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide- the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming. According to the reports released at United Nations’ annual climate change conference, global CO2 emissions appear to be going up. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has been rising extensively since the Industrial Revolution and has now reached dangerous levels not seen in the last 3 million years. In this project, we are tying to understand the contributions of developed and developing nations to global climate forcing and overall CO2 emission. 

## Motivation:

I wanted to work on the global issue as part of my project, so I shortlisted two topics - population explosion and climate change. These two are the most critical problems that the world is facing today. I couldn’t find the enough data which can serve the purpose of deceptive visualization, I decided to go with climate change as the topic of deceptive visualization project. 

Among the major challenges affecting the world today, climate change and destruction of natural resources is the most serious one. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Most scientists agree that the main cause of climate change is human expansion of “greenhouse effect“ – warming that results when atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth towards space. Carbon dioxide(CO2) is an important heat-trapping gas and CO2 emissions contributed significantly towards climate change.  Over the years, human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, burning fossil fuels have increased atmospheric CO2 levels by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution. 

There is a strong need of determining mitigating strategies that seek to hold individuals and nations accountable for their historic emissions. For that, it is a good idea to divide the countries into two groups – developing nations and developed nations. In this visualization, we will try to understand the relative contribution of each group which will us come up with an action plan to reduce the CO2 emission. 

## Objective of visualization:

The world’s countries contribute different amounts of CO2 to atmosphere. We cannot solve the climate change problem without participation of all the countries. In order to figure out the steps necessary to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases in an effort to check global climate change, it is important to study the CO2 emissions by each country. Formulation of targets for emissions reduction for all countries based on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” depends primarily on the quantitative attribution of the responsibilities of developed and developing countries for historical climate change. So, we have divided our analysis into two groups – developed and developing countries. 
The visualization will present the CO2 emissions for last 150 years for developing and developed countries. 

## Datasets:

Here, we have taken CO2 emissions(measured in  million tons) since 1751 till 2013 for almost all the countries in the world.
