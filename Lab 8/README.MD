#### Improvements incorporated in this version
Previous(lab 5) version had a lot of scope of improvement. I implemented following improvements in this version:
1. I changed the metrics to consider more relevant metrics as far as the prospecitve students are concerned. 
The metrics that I considered here are rankings, student to teacher ratio and acceptance rate.

2. Last version was showing a separate chart for each dataset. It was not giving a holistic view in order to make a decision.
