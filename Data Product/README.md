Hi All,

Copy paste this in your README file. Few things are here and there right now, but we'll finalize it today.
This is just to give everybody an idea on how the doc is looking right now. I will share the pictures I have used. I am almost done with the making-of's table. Will add that and share.

# Data Product : Corruption, how it is affecting countries? Is there a solution to it?

### I. Project statement (Motivation, objective, data, project plan)

### The *start* and the *motivation*
*What is a data product?*

Before jumping to anything else, the team first discussed what all a 'Data Product' encompasses.
To answer this better, this youtube video helped us a lot. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuRINNSDtlM

A data product has several definitions. For this project, a data product is a set of visualizations put together to present a story to the audience which has an argument supported by those visualization.

Once the desired outcome of this complete project is understood, the team discussed the **5 W's**
* **Why**   - Why is this *Data Product needed*?
* **Who**   - Who will be the *audience*?
* **What**  - What is the *needs and wants* of the audience?
* **Where** - Where can we get the *relevant data* from?
* **When**  - By when this data is needed? 

*Note:* It doesn't matter how awesome a product is, it will be of no value if not delivered in time. Sometimes a normal product works way better than an awesome product, it totally depends on the time of entry.

### Project plan:
1. To decide on a topic on which a 'Data Product' is to be made.
2. Analyze the data and come up with a possible story.
3. To come up with a claim (for the complete data product), with the selected data.
4. Decide on different metrics to be shown in the product.
4. To create a Minimal Viable Product.
5. Combine the data sets collected from different sources to create a single data set.
5. Make intermediate versions.
6. Analyze intermediate versions and find advantages and disadvantages of them.
7. Come up with the final Data Product.
8. Note down possible enhancements in the final version.
9. Create a video to present my visualization.

### Introduction: Corruption
Corruption is a form of dishonest or unethical conduct by a person entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire personal benefit. Corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries. Government, or 'political', corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain.

The unethical and often illegal nature of corruption makes measurement particularly complicated. Corruption data usually comes from either direct observation (e.g. law enforcement records and audit reports), or perception surveys (e.g. public opinion surveys, or expert assessments). In this project the data taken is from both sources.

**Corruption Perception Index and its importance in our analysis**

Transparency International (TI) has published the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) since 1996, annually ranking countries "by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys." The CPI generally defines corruption as "the misuse of public power for private benefit" 

**Economic implications**
"Research papers published in 2007 and 2008 examined the economic consequences of corruption perception, as defined by the CPI. The researchers found a correlation between a higher CPI and higher long-term economic growth, as well as an increase in GDP growth of 1.7% for every unit increase in a country's CPI score. Also shown was a power-law dependence linking higher CPI score to higher rates of foreign investment in a country."   *Source: Wikipedia*

In this project, we first validated how CPI relates with the reality. We compared CPI with the percentage of people who have actually bribed. This helped in proving that the CPI matches the reality. For further analysis on affects of corruption we used CPI as a metric.

We analyzed how corruption can hinder the Human Development by creating a visualization between HDI and CPI. This helped us in understanding that Human Development is lower in countries where corruption is more. 

Further analyzed how deep rooted are the effects of corruption on a country's **GDP** and how it affects the **Foreign Direct Investment**.

In this project we also added a possible solution to the problem of Corruption and that is **Education**. The message to all the countries is - 'educate your people to eradicate corruption'.

### What is the relationship between corruption and development?
The following visualization shows the cross-country relationship between development (as measured by the United Nations Human Development Index) and corruption (as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index).

As we can see, countries that score higher in the Corruption Perception Index (i.e. countries seen as less corrupt) tend to also have better scores in the Human Development Index.

### V. About the final Data Product
This Data product is a set of several visualization and covers the topic of **Corruption**, its affects and its causes.
In this project the team has created several visuals to represent how different countries are perceived on the parameter of corruption and where they actually lies in reality using the parameter 'percentage of people who actually bribed' in the country. 

Then the second visualization shows how the corruption has been affecting the Human development. This a graph showing Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index.


--------
This visual presents a great insight regarding the problem of corruption. It can be easily observed that the problem of corruption is greater in the region of Asia, Africa and South America. It can be concluded from this visualization that corruption is a problem of a region. It could be possible that corruption gets spreaded to the neighbouring countries and it perceived to be normal in the particular region as most of the countries in these region faces this problem. It would take further analysis and is out of scope of this project, to check wether the problem of corruption has spread from one country to another over the period of time.
--------

### V.	Road map with future features/enhancements
* Add analysis, to check why and how corruption became prevelant in certain areas of the world.
* Analyze the possible effect of erradicating corruption from a country. Although corruption is assumed to be a problem and a factor hindering growth, but it could potentially be needed in certain countries for the purpose of business and a smooth functioning of government bodies. In these countries corruption might be playing a vital role in growth of GDP.
* Further analysis could be done to add more solution to this problem.
