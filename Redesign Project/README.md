### Project Overview:
According to the institute for Women’s Policy Research, women are paid 20 percent less than their male counterparts. Some experts even say that women won’t even reach pay equity until 2151. Even after introducing number of bills across the country aiming at shrinking the pay gap, situation has not changed much for women. With this pay bias, a woman working full time, year-round will lose more than $10,000 a year to the wage gap. As a result women will have less wealth, less resources for their retirement and this will affect overall quality of their life. The aim of this project is to analyze the gender pay group for different age groups to figure out the impact of age on women’s earnings, we will also try find out several reasons behind this pay gap.


### Motivation for this topic:
When I was shortlisting topics for redesigning, I stumbled upon a great visualization on gender pay gap. Coincidently, the very next day I came across an article in Forbes magazine. The article heading compelled me to go through every word of it. It said “Why The Pay Gap Widens As Women Get Older”. Being a woman, I was able to relate with the article. My inquisitive mind started relating these two topics and I thought I should redesign the existing visualization on gender pay gap to find the its behavior as the woman gets older. 

### Intended audience:
_Government, corporate professionals and general public._

### Task of the visualizaion:
This visualization is developed to redesign and improve the existing visualization on gender pay gap.

Original visualization is based on each job role under each occupational category. Hence, it does not a give holistic view
