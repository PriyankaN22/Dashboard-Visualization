### Project Overview:
According to the institute for Women’s Policy Research, women are paid 20 percent less than their male counterparts. Some experts even say that women won’t even reach pay equity until 2151. Even after introducing number of bills across the country aiming at shrinking the pay gap, situation has not changed much for women. With this pay bias, a woman working full time, year-round will lose more than $10,000 a year to the wage gap. As a result women will have less wealth, less resources for their retirement and this will affect overall quality of their life. The aim of this project is to analyze the gender pay group for different age groups to figure out the impact of age on women’s earnings, we will also try find out several reasons behind this pay gap.


### Motivation for this topic:
When I was shortlisting topics for redesigning, I stumbled upon a great visualization on gender pay gap. Coincidently, the very next day I came across an article in Forbes magazine. The article heading compelled me to go through every word of it. It said “Why The Pay Gap Widens As Women Get Older”. Being a woman, I was able to relate with the article. My inquisitive mind started relating these two topics and I thought I should redesign the existing visualization on gender pay gap to find the its behavior as the woman gets older. 

### Intended audience:
_Government, corporate professionals and general public._

### Task of the visualizaion:
This visualization is developed to redesign and improve the existing visualization on gender pay gap. 

#### Critique on the original visualization:

First of all, this visualization is not sorted based on pay gap. Hence it is difficult to figure out in the first look which category has the maximum pay gap. Also, the visualization is based on each job role under each occupational category. Current claim is “Women are getting paid less than their male counterparts”. If we try to relate the claim with the data on the visualization, we see that lot of unnecessary information has been put at once which can distract the audience from the main claim. Holistic view of just the occupational categories would have sufficed the goal.

Secondly, the viz compares the pay gap on the basis of job role which seems inappropriate. Job role in each category can be very different from the job role in another category. For example, skillset of a production worker is completely different than skillset of a lawyer. Hence, comparing these job roles doesn’t give us any useful information. 

Additionally, it would have been helpful if the visualization had the actual pay gap in the tooltip. When we look at the categories like “Laundry & dry-cleaning workers” and “Agricultural workers”, pay gap appears to be the same for both. Actual or percentage pay gap would have helped us differentiate between the two roles. 

Finally, the visualization does not highlight the parameters which can help us in taking effective actions to reduce the pay bias. Neither, does it give the baseline to find out the reasons behind the pay gap. 

#### Scope of improvement: 
In addition to showing the wage gap for each occupational category, visualization should provide some parameters on the basis of which the audience can easily figure out the reasons for pay gap. Once the reasons are clear, it would be easy for them to think about the corrective measures. 

Hence, I took salaries of men and women serving the same occupation as my second dataset in order to find out the reasons behind this bias. This will help us understand what happens to wage gap when a woman gets older. Does her accumulated experience brings fairness in the pay structure? Does her family responsibilities affect her work life? Does she feel motivated to continue her work? We will try to find answer for all of these questions in this report.
