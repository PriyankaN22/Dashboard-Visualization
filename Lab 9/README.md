### Lab 9: 
#### Objective: 
Develop a visualizations on SCU MSIS program that helps recruiters(redesign of visualization developed as part of lab 6)

#### Critique on Lab 6:
•	The visualization has lot of chart junk. There are some unnecessary items which are not required to fulfill the objective

•	Use of color is inappropriate

•	The visualization is confusing since it has lot of information on one page

•	For recruiters, the key metrics are – what are the courses offered, what are the skills possessed by SCU students, what is the ranking and reputation of Santa Clara University and where do SCU alumni work

•	SCU Alumni pay scale is not necessary here. Recruiters may not be interested in knowing the salaries of SCU alumni

•	Pie chart for alumni skills is not required. We are not highlighting any particular skills, so it is a good way to put all the skills in a table chart rather than putting it in a pie chart.

#### Roadmap for improvement:
•	Remove clutter

•	Make proper use of colors

•	Focus only on important and relevant metrics , so remove all unnecessary information. Remove SCU alumni pay scale

•	Improve the aesthetics

•	Remove pie chart for alumni skills

•	Try to find some more relevant metrics such as what is the average work experience of SCU students.

•	Convert the visualization into a storyboard for providing a cognitive walkthrough.

•	Make the project reproducible by writing python code for number of courses offered. Also, improve Jupyter file to make it reproducible.

#### Redesigned version:
##### Claim: 
SCU MSIS degree makes you highly competitive in the market

##### Qualifier: 
Universities in Bay area

##### Warrant: 
Best ranking indicates the academic excellence of the university. 

Also, data analysis and management are among the top 10 skills listed on LinkedIn. Almost 65% of SCU students possess these skills which shows that SCU MSIS degree prepares students to connect the classroom learning to real world business challenges. 

The list of courses offered indicates that MSIS degree gives students exposure to leading edge technology, business practice and potential employers.
